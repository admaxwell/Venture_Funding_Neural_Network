# Venture Funding Neural Network

This project produces a jupyter notebook using google.colab to create a binary classifier model using deep learning. The intent of this project is to use the provided csv which contains finanical information of past clients from the Company Alphabet Soup. The classifier model will evaluate all the metrics of these former clients to determine the probability of success for future companies seeking startup funding from Alphabet Soup.
